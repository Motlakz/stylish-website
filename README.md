### Overview

### The objective

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Access different pages through the links on the header or topbar depending on which device they are on
- Be redirected to the contact form after clicking the 'Sign Up' button.

### My Process

Created a basic website with a semantic layout of navbar, header, section, and footer.
Adapted intermediate CSS Flexbox concepts and advanced CSS properties to make the website more responsive across various devices.
Used the same process to create multiple pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to implement some basic CSS Layout properties and apply intermediate CSS concepts to a static landing page.

### Continued development

I will spend more time working on websites with interactive CSS animations, paired with some JavaScript concepts to make them more vibrant and interactive.
